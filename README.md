# Real-Time-Location-Tracking-Application


Overview 

This project is a real-time location tracking application that leverages WebSocket technology to allow multiple users to share their geolocation data. The application displays the location of all connected users on a map using the Leaflet library and OpenStreetMap tiles. The server-side is built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io for real-time communication.

Features

-> Real-Time Location Sharing: Users can share their real-time geolocation data with other connected users.

-> Dynamic Map Update: The map updates dynamically as users move.

-> User Disconnect Handling: When a user disconnects, their marker is removed from the map.

-> Cross-Platform Compatibility: Utilizes browser geolocation API, compatible with most modern browsers.
